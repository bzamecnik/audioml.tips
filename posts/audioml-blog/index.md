This blog [audioml.tips](http://audioml.tips) is dedicated to people on the crossroads between Audio Processing and Machine Learning. These two fields excite me very much and I have spent there a lot of time. Now I'd like to contribute. The idea is that people from audio/MIR/DSP world could learn more about ML and ML people more about audio.

What content would I like to see here?

- tutorials on methods, tools, etc.
- real-world projects
- interviews with interesting people
- what's new in the world - awesome papers, projects, tools
