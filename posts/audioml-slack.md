> Audio + Machine Learning = ♥!
> A Slack community for people interested in processing audio and teaching machines to understand it. Let's discuss our projects, data, methods, tools, solve the problems together and make the next awesome thing!

As the [ASPMA course](https://class.coursera.org/audio-002) (Audio Signal Processing for Music Applications) at Coursera approached its finish, there were voices in the [forum](https://class.coursera.org/audio-002/forum) where we would meet afterwards. I realized it would be awesome to make a place for like-minded people to meet.

So I created a [channel on Slack](https://audio-ml.slack.com) for people interested in Audio Processing and Machine Learning. Since Slack channels are invite-only I also set up a simple page with a [sign-up form](http://audioml.club) and description of the channel. I'm really happy that some people already became interested and are on the channel.

Feel free to sign-up at [audioml.club](http://audioml.club) and meet other people interested in audio and ML!
